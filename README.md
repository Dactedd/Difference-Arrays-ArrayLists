# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists
In Java, arrays and ArrayLists are both used to store collections of elements, but they have different purposes and features.

Arrays are fixed in size so its size cannot change. They are efficient because you can access elements directly using their index, making them ideal for situations where the size of the collection is known in advance and will not change. Arrays are often used in performance-critical tasks where speed is important. Additionally, arrays can store both primitive types, like int and double, and objects.

ArrayLists, on the other hand, are part of the java.util package and act as resizable arrays. Their size can grow or shrink automatically as elements are added or removed, making them perfect for collections where the size isn’t fixed. ArrayLists only store objects, so for primitive types, they use autoboxing (e.g., Integer for int). ArrayLists also come with built-in methods like add(), remove(), and contains() that make working with them easier and more flexible.

Arrays are generally faster than ArrayLists because they don’t have the overhead of resizing or using additional methods. However, ArrayLists are more versatile because they provide additional functionality, such as sorting and searching. If the collection size is known and performance is critical, arrays are a better choice. If flexibility and ease of use are more important, ArrayLists are the better option.
